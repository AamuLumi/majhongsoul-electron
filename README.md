# Majhong Soul - Standalone client

I just want to play to Majhong Soul out of my good ol' browser, so I wrapped up the app in an Electron client.
I also add a small integration of Discord Rich Presence, because I love to flex on Discord.

The app has been tested on a Macbook M1, so electron-forge is not adapted to a Linux or Windows compilation.
If someone is interested, add an issue and I'll push releases for the platform if I can.

## How to use it

```

## How to build it
