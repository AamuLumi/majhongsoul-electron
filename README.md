# Majhong Soul - Standalone client

I just want to play to Majhong Soul out of my good ol' browser, so I wrapped up the app in an Electron client.
I also add an autostart of the game, so you don't have to click on the "Play Game" button of the website.

The app has been tested on a Macbook M1, so electron-forge is not adapted to a Linux or Windows compilation.
If someone is interested, add an issue and I'll push releases for the platform if I can.

## How to use it

```
npm install
npm start
```

## How to build it

```
npm install
npm run make
```
